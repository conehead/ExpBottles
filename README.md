ExpBottles
==========

A simple Craftbukkit plugin that can be used to bottle experience.

Usage
-----

To bottle experience, put a glass bottle into an enchantment table. Bottling costs 11 experience, and a bottle o'
enchanting drops anywhere between 3 and 11 experience when thrown, meaning that bottling is likely to be a lossy
process.

NOTE: There is visual issue when you initially put the glass bottle into the slot; the bottle doesn't update its
appearance to become a bottle o' enchanting. You have to either click on the bottle again or click anywhere else in your
inventory. This is a Craftbukkit issue, not something I can fix.
