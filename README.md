ExpBottles
==========

A simple Craftbukkit plugin that can be used to bottle experience.

Usage
-----

To bottle experience, put a glass bottle into an enchantment table. Bottling costs 11 experience, and a bottle o'
enchanting drops anywhere between 3 and 11 experience when thrown, meaning that bottling is likely to be a lossy
process.

NOTE: There is an issue where when you initially put the glass bottle into the slot it doesn't update to appear to be a
bottle o' enchanting until you either click on it again or click in another place of your inventory. This is a
Craftbukkit issue, not something I can fix.
